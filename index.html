                <p>
                    From a very young age, I dreamed of becoming a professional ice hockey player.
                    For me, hockey was more than just a sport, it was my sanctuary, a place where I could dream big and
                    work hard to chase those dreams.<br><br>
                    In the beginning, it was all about having fun, making friends, and staying active. But as I got
                    older, the competition grew tougher, and earning a spot on the team became more challenging. Between
                    the ages of 16 and 20, I played at the highest level for juniors. I attended schools that included
                    hockey training as part of the curriculum, practicing 4–5 days a week and playing games 1–2 days
                    each weekend. I dedicated countless hours to becoming the best player I could be.<br><br>
                    Eventually, my priorities shifted. Hockey wasn’t as fun anymore, and I became interested in
                    exploring other areas of life. When I decided to leave the sport, I had no regrets. The years I
                    spent sweating, sacrificing, and striving were invaluable.<br><br>
                    Hockey taught me lessons I carry with me every day. I learned how to set personal goals, work as
                    part of a team, handle wins and losses, and stay dedicated and competitive. Most importantly, I
                    discovered how to play hard, stay fair, and enjoy the journey along the way.

                <p>
                    In 2020, I began my military service at F17 as a Flygbassäkerhetssoldat. Over the course of nine
                    transformative months, I served as a group leader, managing and guiding a team of eight. This
                    experience shaped me in many ways, both personally and professionally.<br><br>
                    During my time in the military, I developed important skills like leadership, teamwork,
                    problem-solving, and time management. I learned how to push limits, both my own and others, and
                    gained a strong understanding of what it takes to lead under pressure. Most importantly, Most
                    importantly, my confidence grew, ready to handle challenges with focus and determination.<br><br>
                    After completing my initial service, I accepted a part-time role as a soldier. I now take part in
                    2–3 military exercises each year, ranging from small-scale drills to larger operations. These
                    activities give me the chance to improve my skills further, with training in leadership, weapon
                    handling, and strategy. Being part of a growing military force that works to protect peace and
                    Sweden’s borders is both exciting and rewarding.
